##This project introduces the intersection of network analysis and epidemic modeling through a hands-on exploration of disease transmission dynamics. Using a dataset of participants from various countries attending a Malaria Modelling modular program in Nairobi, Kenya, participants learn to construct social networks based on participants interaction patterns and simulate disease spread using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model.

##The project aims to demonstrate how network structure influences epidemic outcomes by modeling connections between individuals with a 10% probability, creating a more realistic interaction pattern. The aim is to explore key epidemiological concepts including transmission rates (β), incubation rates (σ), recovery rates (γ), and intervention strategies like wearing masks and identification of superspreaders.

##Through this practical exercise, participants should gain a hands-on experience with network visualization, epidemic simulation, and quantitative analysis of public health interventions. The goals is to emphasize applications by examining scenarios such as the impact of protective measures introduced mid-outbreak and the role of highly connected individuals in accelerating disease spread.

##Exercises are presented at the end of this tutorial
